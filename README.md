# Node-Red_API_Dashboard
This project is to understand how to use Node-Red as a dashboard and play around with several API's. please follow the steps as decribed below.<br/>

1- create a Node-Red app using IBM Cloud.<br/>
2- Deploy and run the app and install nodes.<br/>
3- create your first flow<br/>
4- interact with API's.<br/>
5 create a dashboard.<br/>

# 1- Create a Node-Red app using IBM cloud.<br/>
go to [IBM Cloud](http://cloud.ibm.com) and register for a new account. Once this is finished you can use the catalog and search for Node-Red. This will give you an app which you can use. There is a lite version which is free of charge. Please note that there is a limit of data transfer. Follow the steps to activate and deploy the app on IBM Cloud.<br/>

When you want to install Nodes which are not listed yet there is an option in the upper right hamburger menu called "Manage Palette".
This option allows you to explore installed node packages and install additional ones. if you select the install tab you can search for packagages. Try to find * openweathermap * and hit the install button. This will install several nodes which you can use to interact with the Openwathermap API's which we'll using later in step 4.

# 2- Deploy and run the app and install nodes.<br/>
Once you have your Node-Red app running, you will see an App-URL in your dashboard. The first time you will need to set up a user-id and password or leave it blank (which is not recommended). Once you have completed the initial setup you will be redirected to your node-red environment. Take the time to explore the options and menu structure.<br/>

# 3- Create your first flow.<br/>
Node-Red uses "nodes" as building blocks which are displayed on the left side of the screen. You can drag and drop the nodes to your flow (middle section) and configure the nodes by double clicking. The right side of the screen provides you additional information such as an information screen, a debug window and other options. when selecting a node with a single click you can find information on how to use it on the right side of your screen under the "I" from information.<br/>

to create a first flow you can use the "Inject" node by drag and drop this to your flow in the middle section of your screen. An "inject" node will give an output when clicking on the the little square at the right side of the node. When double clicking the node you can select the output which it will generate. there is a little drop-down option which enables a selection of using several formats like timestamp, number, string, boolean, Json etc. Selecting a Boolean "true" for example will provide a "true" statement on output which can be used to trigger a next node.<br/>

If you want to see what the output of the node is you can use the "Debug" node by drag and drop this on to your Flow. Now connect the output of the "Inject" node, which is the right side, with the input of the "Debug" node by holding your mouse button. This will generate a wired connection.<br/>

The last thing we need to do is activating our flow. This is being done by pressing the Deploy button on the upper right side of the screen. This button will commit any changes and activate your flow. The Deploy button will color red when it detects a change in your flow.<br/>

Select the debug windowon the right side (the little bug icon) to whow the output of your "Debug" node. Now press the inject node to inject a Boolean "True" statement. If its all done correctly a "true" statement will appear in the debug window on the right side of your screen.<br/>

# 4- Interact with API's</br>
Now we are going to use the Openweathermap nodes which we installed in step 2. please find the nodes in your nodelist on the left side and drag and drop it into your flow. connect the "inject"node on the input, and a debug node on the output. It doesnt matter what the inject node will provide. the Openweathermap node will be triggered on any input. </br>

Now doubleclick the Openweathermap node and notice that it requires an API key. This key is needed to have the node intreact with the Ã²penweathermap server and therefore we need to create one. Go to Openweatermap.org (http://openweatemap.org) and create an account. When done you are able to create an API key in thee user menu. The key will be a string of characters. Copy/paste this string in your Openweathermap node. </br>

Last thing we need to do is to select a location from where we want to receive the weatherinformation from. I choose to use London UK but feel free to use any location you want. The website of Openwearhermap provides a list of locations with the proper syntax.

Once you have configure the node properly close it and deploy your flow. Now make sur ethe debug window is open and hit the inject node and look at the debug window. The debug node should now show the output of the Openweathermap node and provide information about the weather information of the chosen location. Expanding the output by clicking the llitthe triangle will show you a list of information. Note that the format is in Json string which is a package called Payload of information.
